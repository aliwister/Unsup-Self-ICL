Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Sally is a beekeeper who has been keeping bees for many years. She recently decided to try a new type of bee food called A X200R. She fed the bees with this food for a few weeks and noticed that the bees seemed to be healthier and more productive than before.
