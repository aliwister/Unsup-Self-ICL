Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Sally is a beekeeper who has been keeping bees for many years. She recently decided to try a new type of bee food called X-Nectar, which was supposed to be more nutritious than her old bee food. After a few weeks, Sally noticed that her bees were producing more honey than usual. She was very pleased with the results, but she also noticed that some of the bees were starting to die. She wondered if the new bee food could be the cause of the bee deaths. Did the use of X-Nectar cause the bees to die?
