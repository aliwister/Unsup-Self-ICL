Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
John is a farmer who grows corn on his farm. He has been using the same fertilizer for years, but this year he decided to try something new. He bought a new fertilizer called X-Fert, which was supposed to be more effective than his old fertilizer.
