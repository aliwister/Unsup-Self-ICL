Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: No
