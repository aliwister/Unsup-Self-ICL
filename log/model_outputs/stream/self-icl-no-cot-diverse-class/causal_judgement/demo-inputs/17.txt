Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the neighbor cause injury to Joe's son?
