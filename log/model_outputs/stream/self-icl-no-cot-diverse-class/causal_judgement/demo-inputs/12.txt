Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is not in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He changes its position, and he puts it in the lock position. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?
