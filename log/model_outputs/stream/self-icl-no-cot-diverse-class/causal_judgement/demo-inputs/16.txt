Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment." The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. The decision was announced by the Chairman of the board, Donald Franklin, whose primary role is to "guide and mediate board actions with respect to organizational priorities and governance concerns." Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was harmed. Did the board intentionally harm the environment?
