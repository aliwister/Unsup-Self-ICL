Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a whale:  name, age, length (m), weight (kg) 
Moby, 7, 10, 11
Willie, 5, 15, 13
Flipper, 9, 12, 11
Gus, 8, 14, 15
For example: the age of Moby is 7, the weight of Gus is 15 kg, the length of Willie is 15 m. We now add a whale to the table:

Nemo, 12, 16, 12

Dory, 5, 2, 620
