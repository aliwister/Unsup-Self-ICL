Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, flipper length (cm), tuxedo color 
John, 5, 30, black 
Emily, 7, 40, white 
Sam, 9, 50, black 
Lily, 11, 60, white 
For example: the age of John is 5, the flipper length of Sam is 50 cm, the tuxedo color of Emily is white. We then delete the penguin named Sam from the table.
