Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, wingspan (cm), beak length (cm) 
Miles, 4, 40, 8 
Olivia, 6, 50, 10 
Noah, 8, 60, 12 
Sophia, 10, 70, 14 
For example: the age of Miles is 4, the wingspan of Noah is 60 cm, the beak length of Olivia is 10 cm. We then delete the penguin named Noah from the table.
How many penguins have a wingspan of less than 50 cm?
