Q: "The following argument seeks to clarify the relationship between the number of hours of sleep and academic performance: To begin with, no student who gets less than 6 hours of sleep per night has an A average.

We may conclude: Getting between 6 and 8 hours of sleep per night is necessary for having an A average."

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap. Moreover, nobody is neither a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap. Finally, every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo. We may conclude: Being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap."
