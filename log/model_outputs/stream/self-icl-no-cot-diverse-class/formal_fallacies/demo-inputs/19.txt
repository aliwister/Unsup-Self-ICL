Following is an example instance for the task: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies. Please come up with 3 new , diverse, and creative instances for the task.
Example instance:
Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: First of all, everyone who is a close friend of Glenna is a close friend of Tamara, too. Next, whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Glenna. Hence, whoever is none of this: a half-sister of Deborah or workmate of Nila, is a close friend of Tamara."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid

New instance 1:
Q: "The following argument pertains to the question of whether or not it is possible to predict the future: If the future is predetermined, then it is possible to predict the future. But, if the future is not predetermined, then it is not possible to predict the future. Therefore, it is possible to predict the future."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid

New instance 2:
Q: "The following argument pertains to the question of whether or not it is possible to travel faster than the speed of light: If the speed of light is the fastest speed possible, then it is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light. But, if the speed of light is not the fastest speed possible, then it is possible to travel faster than the speed of light. Therefore, it is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid

New instance 3:
Q: "The following argument pertains to the question of whether or not it is possible to be successful without hard work: If hard work is necessary for success, then it is not possible to be successful without hard work. But, if hard work is not necessary for success, then it is possible to be successful without hard work. Therefore, it is not possible to be successful without hard work."
