Following is an example instance for the task: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies. Please come up with 3 new , diverse, and creative instances for the task.
Example instance:
Q: "Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, every opponent to FC Mariupol is an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Second, every fan of FC Utrecht is not an ex-supporter of Hertha BSC Berlin or not an ex-supporter of Bayer 04 Leverkusen. So, necessarily, being an opponent to FC Mariupol is sufficient for not being a fan of FC Utrecht."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid

New instance 2:
Q: "Is the sun hot? Is the moon cold? The following argument seeks to clarify the answer: First, every star in the sky is hot. Second, every planet in the solar system is not cold. So, necessarily, the sun is hot and the moon is cold."
