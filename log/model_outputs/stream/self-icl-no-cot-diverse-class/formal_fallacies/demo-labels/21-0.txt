Q: "Is John a brother of Mary? Is Sarah related to Mark? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, John is a cousin of Sarah. Second, nobody is neither a cousin of Sarah nor a brother of Mark. So, necessarily, John is not a brother of Mark."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Invalid
