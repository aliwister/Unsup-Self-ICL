Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is necessary for being an owner of a Lever soap. Second, being an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Dove soap. In consequence, every infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is an owner of a Lever soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
