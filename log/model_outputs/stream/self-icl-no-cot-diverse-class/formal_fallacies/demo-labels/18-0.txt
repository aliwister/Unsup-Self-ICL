Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being a student of Harvard University is sufficient for being a student of Cambridge University. Second, nothing is neither a student of Yale University nor a student of Harvard University. We may conclude: Being a student of Yale University is sufficient for not being a student of Cambridge University."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
