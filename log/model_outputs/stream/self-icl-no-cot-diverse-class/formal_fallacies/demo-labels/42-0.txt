Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First premise: Every student in the class is either a senior or a freshman. So, necessarily, whatever is none of this: a senior or a freshman, is not a student in the class."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
