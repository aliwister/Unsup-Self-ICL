Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, no student in the class is a resident of the same city as their teacher. Now, it is false that John is a resident of the same city as their teacher. Moreover, it is false that John is a student in the class. We may conclude: It is not the case that John is a resident of the same city as their teacher."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
