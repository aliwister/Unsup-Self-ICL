Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, no one who is a member of the Democratic Party is a member of the Republican Party. Second, everyone who is a resident of California is a member of the Democratic Party. Therefore, everyone who is not a resident of California is not a member of the Republican Party."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
