Q: "Is George a grandfather of Alex? Is Peter related to Rachel? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To start with, everyone who is a friend of Jane is an aunt of Nick, too. Now, being an aunt of Nick is sufficient for not being a great-grandparent of Tim. Therefore, no friend of Jane is a great-grandparent of Tim."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Invalid
