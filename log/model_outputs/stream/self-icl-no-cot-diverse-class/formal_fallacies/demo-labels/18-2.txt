Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being a member of the Democratic Party is sufficient for being a member of the United States Congress. Second, nothing is neither a member of the Republican Party nor a member of the Democratic Party. We may conclude: Being a member of the Republican Party is sufficient for not being a member of the United States Congress."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
