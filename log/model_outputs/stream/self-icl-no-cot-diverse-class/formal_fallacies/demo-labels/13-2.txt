Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being a citizen of the United Kingdom is sufficient for being a resident of Europe. Second, whoever is a resident of Europe is not a resident of Africa. Third, every citizen of the United Kingdom who is a resident of Africa is also a resident of Asia. We may conclude: Being a citizen of the United Kingdom is sufficient for being a resident of Asia."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Invalid
