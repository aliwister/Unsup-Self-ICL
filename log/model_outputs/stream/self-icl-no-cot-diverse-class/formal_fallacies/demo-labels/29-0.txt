Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, whoever is a regular user of Dove soap is not a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap. Now, whoever is an owner of a Lush soap and an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is not a regular user of Dove soap. We may conclude: Every owner of a Lush soap who is an infrequent user of Proactiv soap is also a loyal buyer of Paul Mitchell soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
