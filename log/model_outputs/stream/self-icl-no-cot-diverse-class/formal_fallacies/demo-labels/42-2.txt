Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First premise: Every person in the room is either a man or a woman. So, necessarily, whatever is none of this: a man or a woman, is not a person in the room."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
