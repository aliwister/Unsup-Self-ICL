Q: "Is the ocean salty? Is the desert dry? The following argument seeks to clarify the answer: First, every wave in the ocean is salty. Second, every grain of sand in the desert is not dry. So, necessarily, the ocean is salty and the desert is dry."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Invalid
