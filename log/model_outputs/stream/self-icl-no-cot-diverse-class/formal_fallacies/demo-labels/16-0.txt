Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, whoever is a fan of the New York Yankees is not a fan of the Boston Red Sox. Now, whoever is a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers is not a fan of the New York Yankees. Hence, no fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers is a fan of the Boston Red Sox."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
