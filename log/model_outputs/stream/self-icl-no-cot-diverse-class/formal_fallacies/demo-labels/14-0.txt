Q: "Is the sky blue? Is the grass green? The following argument seeks to clarify the answer: First, every cloud in the sky is white. Second, every blade of grass is not white. So, necessarily, the sky is blue and the grass is green."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
