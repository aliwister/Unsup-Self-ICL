Q: "Is the sun hot? Is the moon cold? The following argument seeks to clarify the answer: First, every star in the sky is hot. Second, every planet in the solar system is not cold. So, necessarily, the sun is hot and the moon is cold."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Invalid
