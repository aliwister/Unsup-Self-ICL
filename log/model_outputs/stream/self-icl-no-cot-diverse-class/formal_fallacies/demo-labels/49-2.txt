Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, no one who is a student at Harvard University is a student at Yale University. Second, everyone who is a resident of Massachusetts is a student at Harvard University. Therefore, everyone who is not a resident of Massachusetts is not a student at Yale University."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
