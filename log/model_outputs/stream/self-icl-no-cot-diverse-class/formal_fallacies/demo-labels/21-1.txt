Q: "Is Tom a father of Jane? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, Tom is an uncle of Joe. Second, nobody is neither an uncle of Joe nor a father of Bob. So, necessarily, Tom is not a father of Bob."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
