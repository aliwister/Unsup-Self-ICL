Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, whoever is a student of Harvard University is not a student of Stanford University. Now, whoever is a student of Yale University is not a student of Harvard University. Hence, no student of Yale University is a student of Stanford University."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
