Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, no member of the family is both a resident of the state and a voter of the district. Now, whoever is not a voter of the district is a voter of the precinct. Moreover, nobody is neither a resident of the state nor a voter of the precinct. Hence, everyone who is a member of the family is a voter of the precinct, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
