Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, no employee of the company is both a citizen of the country and a shareholder of the firm. Now, whoever is not a shareholder of the firm is a shareholder of the trust. Moreover, nobody is neither a citizen of the country nor a shareholder of the trust. Hence, everyone who is an employee of the company is a shareholder of the trust, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
