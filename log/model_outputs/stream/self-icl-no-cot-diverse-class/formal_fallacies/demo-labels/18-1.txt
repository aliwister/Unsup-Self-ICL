Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being a resident of California is sufficient for being a resident of the United States. Second, nothing is neither a resident of Mexico nor a resident of California. We may conclude: Being a resident of Mexico is sufficient for not being a resident of the United States."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
