Task description: Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured while exercising. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
