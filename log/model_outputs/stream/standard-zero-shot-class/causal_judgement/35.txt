Task description: Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
