Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: First premise: Being a workmate of Monte is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick. Second premise: Not being an ancestor of Nathan is sufficient for not being a workmate of Monte. It follows that being an ancestor of Nathan is necessary for not being an ancestor of Patrick."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Invalid
