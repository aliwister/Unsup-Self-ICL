Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, everyone who is a grandson of Dominic is a workmate of James, too. Moreover, whoever is neither a son of Cody nor a son of Ivan is a grandson of Dominic. We may conclude: Whoever is none of this: a son of Cody or son of Ivan, is a workmate of James."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
