Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being an ingredient of Hope Moisture Mask is sufficient for being an ingredient of Miracle Concealer. Second, nothing is neither an ingredient of All Day Body Wash nor an ingredient of Hope Moisture Mask. We may conclude: Being an ingredient of All Day Body Wash is sufficient for not being an ingredient of Miracle Concealer."
