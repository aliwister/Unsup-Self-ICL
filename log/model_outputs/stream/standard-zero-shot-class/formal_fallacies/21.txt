Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, Cecil is a schoolmate of Tyler. Second, nobody is neither a schoolmate of Tyler nor a nephew of Owen. So, necessarily, Cecil is not a nephew of Owen."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
