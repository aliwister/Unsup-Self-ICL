Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, no ex-supporter of Getafe CF is a critic of Kilmarnock FC. Second, everyone who is a friend of R. Charleroi SC is a critic of Kilmarnock FC, too. Therefore, whoever is not a friend of R. Charleroi SC is an ex-supporter of Getafe CF."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
