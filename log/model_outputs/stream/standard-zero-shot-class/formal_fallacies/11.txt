Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap is necessary for being an owner of a Lever soap. Second, being an infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is sufficient for being a rare consumer of Nubian Heritage soap. In consequence, every infrequent user of American Crew shampoo is an owner of a Lever soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
