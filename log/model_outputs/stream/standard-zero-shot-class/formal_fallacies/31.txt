Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To start with, no stepbrother of Bryan is both a nephew of Wilburn and a son of Howard. Now, whoever is not a son of Howard is a son of Adrian. Moreover, nobody is neither a nephew of Wilburn nor a son of Adrian. Hence, everyone who is a stepbrother of Bryan is a son of Adrian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
