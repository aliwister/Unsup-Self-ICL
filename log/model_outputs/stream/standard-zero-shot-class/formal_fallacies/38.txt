Task description: Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: First, being an ancestor of Christy is necessary for being a daughter of Denise. Second, not being a cousin of Maryann is sufficient for not being an ancestor of Christy. We may conclude that whoever is not a daughter of Denise is a cousin of Maryann."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid
A: Valid
