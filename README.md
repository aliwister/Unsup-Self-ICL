# Self-ICL: Zero-Shot In-Context Learning with Self-Generated Demonstrations

This is the official repository of our paper [Self-ICL: Zero-Shot In-Context Learning with Self-Generated Demonstrations](), *EMNLP* 2023.

*TL;DR*: This work presents Self-ICL, a framework bootstrapping large LMs' intrinsic capabilities for zero-shot in-context learning via self-generated demonstrations.

Link to our paper and a fully detailed readme will be added soon.
